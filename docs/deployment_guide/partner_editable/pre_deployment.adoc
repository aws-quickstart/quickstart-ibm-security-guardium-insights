== Predeployment steps

=== Create an Amazon S3 bucket for your OpenShift pull secret

This Quick Start requires an Amazon S3 bucket, a Red Hat OpenShift subscription, and your Red Hat OpenShift pull secret to provision the OpenShift cluster.

1. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html[Create an Amazon S3 bucket] in the AWS Region you want to use for the deployment.
2. https://www.redhat.com/wapps/ugc/register.html?_flowId=register-flow&_flowExecutionKey=e1s1[Create a Red Hat account^] if you don't have one.
3. Log in to your Red Hat account and sign up for an OpenShift subscription. A https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/try-it[60-day trial of OpenShift^] is available.
4. Download your https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/aws/installer-provisioned[OpenShift pull secret^] from Red Hat.
5. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/upload-objects.html[Upload] your pull secret to the S3 bucket.

NOTE: During Quick Start deployment, enter the pull secret for the `Red Hat OpenShift pull secret` (`RedhatPullSecret`) parameter.

=== {partner-product-name} subscription

This Quick Start requires an IBM entitlement key from the https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary[IBM Container Library^]. During deployment, enter the IBM entitlement key for the `Repository password` (`RepositoryPassword`) parameter.

=== Domain name and TLS certificates

This Quick Start requires a domain name registered in Amazon Route 53 to use for OpenShift. For more information, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-register.html[Registering a new domain^].

To create your own fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the {partner-product-name}, add a DNS record to your hosted zone in Amazon Route 53.

. Go to Amazon Route 53 console. https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/route53[Click here^].
. Choose the hosted zone that corresponds to the domain name you will use when creating the stack.
. Choose *Create Record*.
. Enter a value for record name, this record will be used for the {partner-product-name} *HostName* parameter value when creating the stack.
+
WARNING: Make sure that your FQDN must not be the same as the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster FQDN, or any other FQDN associated with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
+
. Confirm that the record type is `CNAME`.
. For the value of the record, specify `console-openshift-console.apps.ClusterName.DomainName`, where *ClusterName* and *DomainName* are the respective input parameters used when creating the stack.
. For the routing policy, pick `Simple routing`, and then choose *Create record*, as shown in <<_create_dns_record>>.

{empty} +
If you are using your own FQDN, you must provide an optional `TLS certificate` and `TLS key`, that use keys that are signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). A custom TLS certificate is required, if the provided server keys are not signed by a trusted certificate authority. For more information, see the {partner-product-name} documentation on https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/guardium-insights/3.1.x?topic=planning-domain-name-tls-certificates[Domain Name and TLS Certificates^].

Upload the TLS certificate, TLS key and custom TLS certificate to your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. The Quick Start pulls these certificates and keys from your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket location for {partner-product-name} deployment.
