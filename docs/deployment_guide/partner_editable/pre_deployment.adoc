//Include any predeployment steps here, such as signing up for a Marketplace AMI or making any changes to a partner account. If there are no predeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Predeployment steps

=== Create an Amazon S3 bucket

Before deploying this Quick Start, you must create an Amazon S3 bucket in the AWS Region you want to use. This bucket stores the Red Hat OpenShift pull secret, which the deployment requires. You can also use it to store a TLS certificate and keys, which are optional. For more information, refer to the following:

* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html[Creating a bucket^].
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/upload-objects.html[Uploading objects^].

=== Sign up for a Red Hat subscription

This Quick Start requires a Red Hat OpenShift subscription. To get a subscription, first https://www.redhat.com/wapps/ugc/register.html?_flowId=register-flow&_flowExecutionKey=e1s1[create a Red Hat account] if you don't have one. Then log in to access a https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/try-it[60-day trial of OpenShift] or purchase a subscription.

Download your https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/aws/installer-provisioned[OpenShift pull secret^] from Red Hat and upload it to the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket you create. During Quick Start deployment, enter the pull secret in the `Red Hat OpenShift pull secret` parameter. The Quick Start uses the secret you provide to provision the cluster.

=== {partner-product-name} subscription

* The Quick Start requires an entitlement key to access the {partner-product-name} content.
  ** You can acquire your IBM entitlement key from https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary[IBM Container Library^].
  ** During stack creation you will need to pass the IBM entitlement key as the `RepositoryPassword` parameter.

=== Domain name and TLS certificates

Confirm that you have a domain name to use for OpenShift in Amazon Route 53. If you do not have a domain name, see the AWS documentation on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-register.html[Registering a new domain^].

To create your own FQDN for the {partner-product-name}, add a DNS record to your hosted zone in Amazon Route 53.

The following procedure explains how to create records using the Amazon Route 53 console.

. Go to Amazon Route 53 console. https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/route53[Click here^].
. Choose the hosted zone that corresponds to the domain name you will use when creating the stack.
. Choose *Create Record*.
. Enter a value for record name, this record will be used for the {partner-product-name} *HostName* parameter value when creating the stack.
+
WARNING: Make sure that your FQDN must not be the same as the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster FQDN, or any other FQDN associated with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
+
. Confirm that the record type is `CNAME`.
. For the value of the record, specify `console-openshift-console.apps.ClusterName.DomainName`, where *ClusterName* and *DomainName* are the respective input parameters used when creating the stack.
. For the routing policy, pick `Simple routing`, and then choose *Create record*, as shown in <<_create_dns_record>>.

If you are using your own FQDN, you must provide an optional `TLS certificate` and `TLS key`, that use keys that are signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). A custom TLS certificate is required, if the provided server keys are not signed by a trusted certificate authority. For more information, see the {partner-product-name} documentation on https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/guardium-insights/3.1.x?topic=planning-domain-name-tls-certificates[Domain Name and TLS Certificates^].

Upload the TLS certificate, TLS key and custom TLS certificate to your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. The Quick Start pulls these certificates and keys from your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket location for {partner-product-name} deployment.
