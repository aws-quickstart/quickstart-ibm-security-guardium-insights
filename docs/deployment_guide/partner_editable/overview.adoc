Advanced analytics also support finding and alerting on anomalous activity related to databases, tables, and users.

*Dynamic dashboard with risk-based views:* Understand your data security and compliance position at-a-glance, and then click through to investigate and drill into the who, what, where, and why behind risks and issues. Risk-based views and prioritization, generated by our proprietary risk engine, help data security teams know where to focus to work more efficiently.
