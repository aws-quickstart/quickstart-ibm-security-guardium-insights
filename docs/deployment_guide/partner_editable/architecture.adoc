image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A single-AZ reference architecture.
* A virtual private cloud configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnet:
** A managed network address translation (NAT) gateway to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnet.*
** An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance for a boot node and bastion host to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnet.
* In the private subnet, a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) cluster made up of the following:
** Control plane nodes to manage the cluster and run the OpenShift web console.
** Compute nodes in an OpenShift autoscaling group. Guardim Insights runs as a containerized application on the compute nodes.
* Network Load Balancers for routing internal and external OpenShift API traffic to control plane nodes.
* A Classic Load Balancer for accessing Guardium Insights on compute nodes from a web browser.
* Amazon Elastic Block Storage (Amazon EBS) for volumes attached to compute nodes to persist container data.
* Amazon Route 53 for the public Domain Name System (DNS) for resolving domain names of the Guardium Insights console and deployed applications.
* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to store the OpenShift pull secret, TLS certificate and key, and OpenShift image registry.
* AWS Secrets Manager to encrypt, store, and retrieve credentials and secrets for the Guardium Insights deployment.
